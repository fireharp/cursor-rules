# Task: Follow-up Improvements for manager_rules.go Refactoring

## Task Steps

### High Priority

- [x] Step 1: Update `TestAddRuleByReference` to test the handler-based implementation
- [x] Step 2: Refactor `TestRestoreFromShared` to work with the new structure
- [x] Step 3: Review and update or remove `TestResolveRuleFallback`
- [x] Step 4: Replace string-based error detection (`template_found:`) with custom error types
- [x] Step 5: Improve error aggregation in glob handlers

### Medium Priority

- [x] Step 6: Move `processLocalFile` from `manager_glob.go` to `manager_local_handlers.go`
- [x] Step 7: Implement the `TODO` in `getDefaultUsername`
- [ ] Step 8: Review and standardize handler consistency (especially for glob handlers)

### Low Priority

- [ ] Step 9: Add specific unit tests for each handler's functionality
- [ ] Step 10: Review dependencies (especially `templates` in `manager_glob.go`)

## Full Task Description

After successfully refactoring the `manager_rules.go` file to use the Strategy Pattern, we identified several additional improvements to enhance the quality, maintainability, and testability of the code.

This task focuses on addressing these remaining issues to further strengthen the refactored codebase.

## Areas of Focus

### Testing Improvements

The current tests need to be updated to properly exercise the new handler architecture. In particular:

- `TestAddRuleByReference` should test various reference types to ensure the correct handlers are invoked
- `TestRestoreFromShared` needs refactoring as it currently mentions manually replicating logic
- `TestResolveRuleFallback` is skipped and refers to a non-existent function

### Error Handling Enhancements

- Replace string-based error detection (`template_found:`) with custom error types for improved robustness
- Better error aggregation in glob handlers when multiple files fail
- Consider using proper error packages to improve error handling throughout the codebase

### Code Organization and Consistency

- Move `processLocalFile` from `manager_glob.go` to `manager_local_handlers.go` for better organization
- Implement the `TODO` in `getDefaultUsername`
- Review handler consistency to ensure uniform behavior across all handlers

## Expected Outcome

A more robust, testable, and consistent codebase with improved error handling and organization. These enhancements will build upon the successful refactoring already completed.
