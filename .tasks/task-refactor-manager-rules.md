# Task: Refactor manager_rules.go

## Task Steps

- [x] Step 1: Create a backup of the current manager_rules.go file
- [x] Step 2: Create a new structure for handling different reference types
- [x] Step 3: Extract lockfile update logic to a separate function
- [x] Step 4: Remove goto statements with proper control flow
- [x] Step 5: Create handler interfaces and implementations for different reference types
- [x] Step 6: Refactor the addRuleByReferenceImpl function to use the handlers
- [x] Step 7: Test the refactored code
- [x] Step 8: Update documentation

## Full Task Description

Refactor the manager_rules.go file to improve its structure and remove goto statements. The main issues that need to be addressed are:

1. The file is too large and contains complex control flow with goto statements
2. The addRuleByReferenceImpl function has a large if/else chain to detect reference types
3. There's potential duplication in local file handling logic

The refactoring will focus on creating a cleaner structure with handler interfaces for different reference types, proper error handling, and removal of goto statements.

## Considerations

- Ensure backward compatibility
- Maintain the same behavior for all reference types
- Improve testability
- Create more focused files by responsibility
