## PROBLEM: Need to address golangci-lint issues in codebase

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Created comprehensive plan for resolving linter issues
- Organized linting fixes into priority levels:
  - High: HTTP context issues, unwrapped errors, long lines
  - Medium: Complex nested blocks, high cognitive complexity
  - Low: Long functions, markdown formatting
- Created task-resolve-linting-issues.md with detailed task steps

---

MEMO:

The linting issues will be tackled in order of priority to ensure code stability throughout the refactoring process. Key improvements include:

- Adding proper context to HTTP requests for better cancellation support
- Wrapping errors with context for improved error tracing
- Refactoring complex functions into smaller, more testable units

The complete implementation plan provides a systematic approach to improving code quality while maintaining existing functionality.

## TS: 2025-03-24 05:38:18 CET

## PROBLEM: Need comprehensive linting and CI check setup for code quality

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Added .golangci.yml with customized configuration for the project
- Updated taskfile.yml with comprehensive linting tasks:
  - General lint task that runs all linters
  - Specialized tasks for golangci-lint, nilaway, markdownlint, and govulncheck
  - Added code coverage reporting
- Created GitHub Actions workflows:
  - PR checks workflow for pull requests
  - Release workflow with quality gates
  - Added security scanning with Gosec and govulncheck

---

MEMO:

This comprehensive linting setup improves code quality by catching potential issues early. The main workflow involves:

1. Running `task lint` locally before committing
2. CI checks that run automatically on PRs
3. Additional quality gates during release

Developers can run individual linting tasks or use `task check` to run everything at once. This approaches matches industry best practices with specific focus on Go codebase quality.

## TS: 2025-03-24 05:28:39 CET

## PROBLEM: Unchecked error returns detected by golangci-lint

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Fixed unchecked errors from `os.MkdirAll` in manager_test.go
- Handled errors from `fmt.Scanln` in multiple places in manager.go
- Added proper error checking for `newLock.Save` in manager.go
- Improved error handling for user input scenarios by adding sensible defaults when input fails

---

MEMO:

Proper error handling improves code robustness. For user input via `fmt.Scanln`, we now handle cases where input might fail (e.g., when pressing Enter without typing anything) by providing sensible defaults. For file operations, we now properly propagate errors to the caller for better debugging and user feedback.

## TS: 2025-03-24 05:25:44 CET

## PROBLEM: Code quality issues identified by CodeRabbit review

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Fixed duplicate word in PROGRESS.md ("rule rule" -> "rule content")
- Removed trailing punctuation from headings in task-share-rules-feature.md
- Added missing article "a" before "shareable file" in task description
- Commented out debug log statements in manager_test.go for cleaner test output

---

MEMO:

These changes improve code readability and adherence to style conventions. Removing debug logs from production test code keeps test output cleaner while still allowing developers to uncomment them when needed for debugging.

## TS: 2025-03-18 22:40:24 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to set up Cursor Rules for this project

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Initialized Cursor Rules using `go-claude/bin/cursor-rules setup` command
- Created .cursor/rules directory with appropriate templates:
  - init.mdc - Contains initialization instructions
  - setup.mdc - Project setup template
  - general.mdc - General purpose rules

---

MEMO:

- Cursor Rules are now ready to use in this project
- Templates have been adapted to the detected project type
- Rules will help improve AI assistance for this codebase

## TS: 2025-03-18 22:15:19 CET

## PROBLEM: Need structured testing approach for the MVP implementation

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Created testing instructions for validating the MVP implementation
- Provided detailed manual testing steps for both npm/React and Python projects
- Documented expected outcomes for each project type
- Added proper cleanup instructions after testing

---

MEMO:

- To manually test the MVP, follow these steps:
  1. Build the binary: `go build -o bin/cursor-rules ./cmd/cursor-rules`
  2. Create test directories: `mkdir -p bin/test/{npm-project,python-project}`
  3. Create test package.json: `echo '{ "name": "test", "dependencies": { "react": "18.2.0" } }' > bin/test/npm-project/package.json`
  4. Create test setup.py: `echo 'from setuptools import setup; setup(name="test")' > bin/test/python-project/setup.py`
  5. Test npm init: `cd bin/test/npm-project && ../../cursor-rules --init`
  6. Test npm setup: `cd bin/test/npm-project && ../../cursor-rules --setup`
  7. Test Python init: `cd bin/test/python-project && ../../cursor-rules --init`
  8. Test Python setup: `cd bin/test/python-project && ../../cursor-rules --setup`
  9. Cleanup after testing: `rm -rf bin/test`
- Expected outcomes:
  - npm project: init.mdc, setup.mdc, react.mdc, general.mdc
  - Python project: init.mdc, setup.mdc, python.mdc, general.mdc

## TS: 2025-03-18 22:18:38 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to simplify command syntax and add shortcuts for better user experience

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Updated main.go to support both flag-style and command-style syntax:
  - `cursor-rules --init` → can now also use `cursor-rules init`
  - `cursor-rules --setup` → can now also use `cursor-rules setup`
- Added `CR_SETUP` as an alias for `CursorRules.setup` for use in Cursor editor
- Updated templates to document these new aliases
- Modified code to support this more intuitive command structure

---

MEMO:

- The tool can now be used with simpler commands:
  1. `cursor-rules init` - Creates the .cursor/rules directory with just the init template
  2. `cursor-rules setup` - Detects project type and sets up appropriate rules
- Inside Cursor editor, users can now use either:
  - `CursorRules.setup` (original command)
  - `CR_SETUP` (new shorter alias)
- Both the flag-style (`--init`, `--setup`) and command-style syntax work

## TS: 2025-03-18 22:26:34 CET

## PROBLEM: Needed to test cursor-rules functionality with example projects

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Built the cursor-rules binary using `go build -o bin/cursor-rules ./cmd/cursor-rules`
- Tested initialization in example npm project with `cursor-rules init`
- Verified creation of .cursor/rules directory with init.mdc file
- Tested setup in example npm project with `cursor-rules setup`
- Confirmed detection of npm/Node.js project with React dependency
- Verified creation of setup.mdc, react.mdc, and general.mdc files
- Tested initialization in example Python project with `cursor-rules init`
- Tested setup in example Python project with `cursor-rules setup`
- Confirmed detection of Python project
- Verified creation of setup.mdc, python.mdc, and general.mdc files

---

MEMO:

- The cursor-rules tool successfully detects project types and sets up appropriate rules
- Both flag-style and command-style syntax work as expected
- Each project type gets appropriate rule templates based on detected dependencies
- The testing confirmed that both npm/React and Python projects are properly supported

# Project Progress

## TS: 2025-03-22 16:19:11 CET

## PROBLEM: Need a more robust rule creation system with specialized components for planning, writing, critiquing, and finalizing

WHAT WAS DONE: Implemented a multi-agent architecture using Mastra's agent and workflow system:

1. Created four specialized agents:
   - Rule Planner: Analyzes examples and creates a detailed plan using GPT-4o-mini
   - Rule Writer: Implements the plan to write the actual content
   - Rule Critic: Evaluates the rule against the request, providing feedback
   - Rule Finalizer: Incorporates feedback to produce the polished final rule
2. Developed a workflow that orchestrates these agents in sequence
3. Updated the CLI to integrate with the new workflow

---

MEMO: This pipeline approach significantly improves rule quality through separation of concerns. Each agent specializes in one aspect of rule creation, leading to more thoughtful planning, consistent implementation, thorough evaluation, and higher-quality output. The system leverages example analysis for better categorization and style matching.

## TS: 2025-03-22 16:21:01 CET

## PROBLEM: Need persistent memory in the rule creation system to maintain context across sessions

WHAT WAS DONE: Integrated Mastra's memory system into the rule creation workflow:

1. Added Memory configuration to the Mastra instance with:
   - Message history (lastMessages: 40)
   - Semantic search (topK: 5, messageRange: 2)
   - Working memory for persistent information
   - Thread title generation
2. Updated CLI to use resource and thread IDs for memory context
3. Added @mastra/memory dependency to package.json

---

MEMO: The memory system enables the agents to remember previous conversations and maintain context between sessions. This improves the quality of rules by allowing the system to learn from past interactions and reference previous work. Working memory helps maintain important context even with limited message history.

## TS: 2025-03-22 16:26:27 CET

## PROBLEM: Build is failing due to incorrect imports and TypeScript errors

WHAT WAS DONE:

1. Attempted to fix tool imports using @mastra/core/tools
2. Created multi-agent architecture files (orchestrator.ts)
3. Identified multiple TypeScript errors:
   - Wrong imports: 'agent' instead of 'Agent', 'toolWithDescription' instead of 'createTool'
   - Missing type declarations for parameters
   - Incorrect API usage for agent methods

---

MEMO: Need to update all agent files to use the correct Mastra API. Each agent should use the Agent class from @mastra/core with proper type definitions. The tools need to be updated to use createTool instead of toolWithDescription. Additional types need to be defined for all function parameters.

## TS: 2025-03-22 17:04:41 CET

## PROBLEM: Unclear where rules are saved in the Mastra-based rule creation system

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Analyzed the code to determine where and how rules are stored
- Identified that rules are saved to the local file system, not to Mastra docs or examples
- Found that rules are saved to a "generated-rules" directory in the project root
- Confirmed that the saving happens in src/index.ts, not within the Mastra system itself

---

MEMO: The rule creation workflow uses Mastra (plan, write, critique, finalize steps), but the actual file saving happens in the host application. Rules are organized by category paths in the generated-rules directory (e.g., "generated-rules/general/rule-name.mdc"). The Mastra workflow manages the creation process, while file persistence is handled by the host application.

## TS: 2025-03-22 19:27:09 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to plan implementation of a package manager-style API for cursor rules

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Created task.md file with detailed implementation plan
- Outlined 5 major steps for adding package manager functionality
- Designed two-layer architecture approach with low-level manager package and high-level CLI commands
- Documented necessary changes to existing code while maintaining backward compatibility

---

MEMO: The package manager-style API will provide npm-like functionality (add, remove, upgrade, list) while tracking installed rules in a lockfile. This approach allows for more granular management of rules and creates a foundation for future features like versioning and remote rule repositories.

## TS: 2025-03-23 00:11:27 CET

## PROBLEM: URL detection in the add command not working correctly

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Fixed the `add` command to detect URLs and file paths automatically
- Added smart routing to use `AddRuleByReference` when a URL or file path is detected
- Maintained support for traditional category-based rule addition for other cases
- Tested with GitHub URLs to ensure proper detection and handling
- Improved user experience by eliminating the need to use different commands for different reference types

---

MEMO: The enhancement makes the `cursor-rules add` command smarter by automatically detecting if the argument is a URL, file path, or rule key. URL and file paths are now routed to `AddRuleByReference` while traditional rule keys still use category-based `AddRule`. This means users can now use `cursor-rules add https://github.com/...` directly without needing to remember to use the `add-ref` command, making the CLI more intuitive and user-friendly.

## TS: 2025-03-23 00:16:10 CET

## PROBLEM: Command API needed simplification and standardization on reference-based rule addition

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Removed the category-based `add` command in favor of reference-based rule addition
- Made `add` and `add-ref` both use `AddRuleByReference`, with `add-ref` becoming an alias
- Updated all core functions (init, setup) to use the reference-based approach
- Simplified the help text to focus on file/URL references for better usability
- Updated documentation to reflect the simplified command interface
- Made sure all tests still pass with the new implementation

---

MEMO: The command interface is now more consistent and simpler to use. Instead of requiring users to know which category a rule belongs to, all rules are now simply added by referencing their source - either a local file or a GitHub URL. This creates a more intuitive workflow that matches modern package managers. The `add-ref` command is retained as an alias for `add` to maintain backward compatibility with existing scripts.

## TS: 2025-03-23 00:48:07 CET

## PROBLEM: README.md needed restructuring to improve user experience

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Reorganized README.md structure to prioritize user-centric information
- Added "Quick Start" section at the top with essential commands
- Moved installation and development sections to the bottom
- Simplified command reference to focus on the most common use cases
- Updated examples to reflect the new reference-based command interface
- Removed redundant "Package Manager Commands" section for clarity
- Created more logical flow from quick start to usage to examples

---

MEMO: The updated README now follows a more user-focused structure, presenting the most immediately useful information first. New users can quickly get started with the top Quick Start section, then learn more about usage patterns, while development and installation details are appropriately placed at the bottom for those who need them. This organization better aligns with the simplified command interface that now relies entirely on reference-based rule addition.

## TS: 2025-03-23 21:19:24 CET

## PROBLEM: Enhance the "upgrade" command to properly track and update GitHub-based rules

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Added ContentSHA256 field to the RuleSource struct to track local modifications
- Enhanced handleGitHubBlob to store resolved commit hash and content hash
- Implemented a smarter UpgradeRule function that:
  - Detects local modifications to rule files
  - Checks if the latest commit on the branch has changed
  - Prompts the user before overwriting local changes
  - Displays commit hash changes during upgrades
- Added utility functions for Git commit handling

---

MEMO: The upgrade command now provides a true package-manager style experience:

- Rules from branches (like main) can be updated to the latest commit
- Rules pinned to specific commits remain pinned unless explicitly upgraded
- Local modifications are detected and protected
- The tool shows the exact commit hash changes during upgrades

## TS: 2025-03-23 22:46:01 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to implement "share rules" and "restore from shared" functionality

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Implemented ShareRules function in the manager package to export rules to a JSON file
- Created ShareableLock and ShareableRule structs to define the sharing format
- Added share command to the CLI with options for embedding content
- Implemented RestoreFromShared function to import rules from a shared JSON file
- Added restore command to the CLI with conflict resolution options
- Fixed compatibility between share and restore by ensuring they use the same format
- Added support for embedded content in shared rules
- Tested full sharing and restoring workflow across different directories

---

MEMO:

The share and restore functionality enables easy transfer of rules between projects or users. The implemented JSON format includes rule metadata and can optionally embed the actual rule content. When restoring shared rules, users can choose how to handle conflicts (skip/rename/overwrite) using the --auto-resolve flag. This feature is particularly useful for team collaboration and for maintaining consistent rule sets across multiple projects.

## TS: 2025-03-23 23:47:32 CET

## PROBLEM: Restore command only worked with local files, not URLs

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Enhanced RestoreFromShared function to detect URLs and download content from them
- Updated command-line help text to indicate URL support
- Added detailed usage examples in README.md showing URL-based restoration
- Improved error handling for network failures
- Ensured consistent behavior between local file and URL-based restoration

---

MEMO:

This enhancement allows users to restore rules directly from URLs, making it easier to share rules across teams without having to download the file first. Users can now run `cursor-rules restore https://example.com/shared-rules.json` to directly import rules from a web source. This is particularly useful for teams that maintain a centralized repository of rule configurations on a shared server or for accessing rules directly from GitHub or other hosting services.

## TS: 2025-03-24 05:57:29 CET

## PROBLEM: Linting issues in the codebase

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Fixed octal literal syntax in manager_test.go (0755 -> 0o755)
- Reduced nesting complexity in manager_test.go by inverting conditions
- Replaced len(word) > 0 with word != "" in templates.go
- Combined parameter types in function definitions (string, string, string -> string, string, string)
- Removed empty if block in manager.go
- Fixed indent-error-flow by removing else block and outdenting its contents
- Added missing SourceTypeLocalAbs and SourceTypeLocalRel cases in switch statement
- Renamed unused parameters to \_ for better code clarity
- Added constants for conflict resolution actions (ActionSkip, ActionOverwrite, ActionRename)
- Fixed nil error return issues by returning formatted errors

---

MEMO:

While many linting issues have been fixed, some more complex issues remain:

- High cyclomatic and cognitive complexity in several functions
- Nested if statements with high complexity
- Line length issues in markdown files
- HTTP requests with variable URLs that need context

These issues would require more substantial refactoring, potentially breaking existing functionality. The current fixes focus on the most straightforward issues that can be safely addressed without significant code restructuring.

## TS: 2025-03-24 06:00:14 CET

## PROBLEM: Need a clear roadmap for remaining linting issues

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Updated lint-fixes/plan.md with a detailed inventory of remaining issues
- Prioritized issues into high, medium, and low priority categories
- Added specific file and line references for each issue
- Provided recommended fixes for each linting error
- Organized a strategic approach for tackling remaining issues (security first, then readability, then complex refactoring)

---

MEMO:

The updated plan provides a clear roadmap for addressing the remaining linting issues. High-priority items include HTTP context issues, unwrapped errors, and long lines in code. Medium-priority items focus on reducing complexity in nested blocks and high cognitive complexity functions. The plan acknowledges that some complex refactoring should be deferred to avoid potential breaking changes and suggests creating separate tasks for each complex function.

## TS: 2025-03-24 06:26:23 CET

## PROBLEM: Linter reported HTTP context and unwrapped error issues

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Fixed HTTP context issues (noctx) by:
  - Added context parameters to network-related functions
  - Modified HTTP requests to use http.NewRequestWithContext
  - Updated function calls across the codebase to pass context.Background()
- Fixed unwrapped errors (wrapcheck) by:
  - Added proper error wrapping with fmt.Errorf and %w
  - Added context to errors from filepath.Walk and filepath.Rel
  - Improved error messages to include relevant paths and operations

---

MEMO:

Adding HTTP context support makes the code more robust by allowing for proper timeout and cancellation handling in network requests. The error wrapping improvements make debugging easier by providing more context about where and why errors occurred. These changes follow Go best practices for error handling and network operations.

## TS: 2025-03-24 05:50:35 CET

## PROBLEM: Code quality issues in Go codebase flagged by golangci-lint

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Updated file permission constants to use modern octal syntax (0o600 instead of 0644)
- Fixed file permission constants in test files (0o755 and 0o644)
- Converted if-else chains to switch statements for better readability:
  - Fixed if-else chains in pkg/manager/manager.go
  - Fixed if-else chains in pkg/templates/templates.go
- Added proper error handling for ignored errors:
  - Fixed error handling in pkg/templates/custom.go for ReadString calls
  - Fixed error handling in pkg/manager/manager.go for LoadLockFile calls
- Replaced deprecated strings.Title with a custom implementation using unicode.ToTitle

---

MEMO:

Go 1.13+ recommends using the 0o prefix for octal literals. The switch statements improve code readability and maintainability. Proper error handling is essential for production-quality code. Using unicode.ToTitle instead of the deprecated strings.Title ensures better compatibility with future Go versions.

## TS: 2025-03-24 06:27:56 CET

## PROBLEM: Need a strategic approach for remaining linter issues

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Successfully fixed high-priority linting issues:
  - Added context to HTTP requests (noctx issues)
  - Properly wrapped error returns (wrapcheck issues)
  - Fixed long lines (lll issues)
- Created detailed task file (.tasks/task-resolve-linting-issues.md)
- Documented remaining issues and their complexity
- Prioritized remaining work for future PRs

---

MEMO:

The remaining linting issues (cognitive complexity, nested blocks, long functions) require more extensive refactoring that should be approached with caution. The recommended strategy is to:

1. Address each major function in a separate, focused PR
2. Start with extract method refactoring for clear sub-tasks
3. Add tests before refactoring to ensure behavior doesn't change
4. Apply consistent patterns across the codebase

This phased approach minimizes risk while steadily improving code quality.

## TS: 2025-03-24 06:27:30 CET

## PROBLEM: Long lines detected by linter

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Fixed long lines (lll) issues in main.go
- Split flag descriptions across multiple lines using string concatenation
- Improved code readability by breaking long parameter descriptions

---

MEMO:

Addressing line length issues improves code readability and maintainability. While these issues are relatively minor compared to the context and error handling fixes, they're part of keeping a consistent, clean codebase that follows standard Go conventions.

## TS: 2025-03-24 06:40:30 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to reduce code complexity flagged by golangci-lint

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Created task-refactor-complexity.md with detailed implementation plan
- Prioritized functions for refactoring based on complexity scores:
  1. main() in cmd/cursor-rules/main.go (complexity: 138)
  2. RestoreFromShared() in pkg/manager/manager.go (complexity: 98)
  3. UpgradeRule() in pkg/manager/manager.go (complexity: 67)
- Developed refactoring approach using:
  - Guard clauses to flatten nested conditionals
  - Helper function extraction to reduce complexity
  - Subcommand separation in CLI code

---

MEMO:

The code complexity is hindering maintainability and making changes risky. The implementation will follow best practices like:

- Making incremental changes that can be tested independently
- Keeping function responsibilities clear and focused
- Using descriptive naming for extracted functions
- Adding appropriate comments for new functions

Each major function will be refactored separately to minimize risk while steadily improving code quality.

## TS: 2025-03-24 06:46:43 CET

## PROBLEM: High cognitive complexity in main() function (complexity: 138) flagged by golangci-lint

WHAT WAS DONE: Refactored main.go to use dedicated command handler functions and guard clauses, reducing complexity:

1. Added type definitions for command flags and flag sets
2. Extracted flag definitions into separate function
3. Extracted environment initialization into dedicated function
4. Created specific handler functions for each subcommand
5. Implemented early returns and guard clauses to flatten control flow
6. Improved error handling with proper error wrapping

---

MEMO: This refactoring is part of a larger effort to reduce code complexity as documented in tasks/task-refactor-complexity.md. Key benefits:

- Reduced cognitive complexity of main() function
- Improved maintainability with single-responsibility functions
- Better error handling with proper context
- More readable command processing with dedicated handlers
- Easier to add new commands in the future

The next functions to refactor are RestoreFromShared() and UpgradeRule() in pkg/manager/manager.go.

## TS: 2025-03-24 06:53:37 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to verify the main.go refactoring fixed linting issues and preserved functionality

WHAT WAS DONE: Tested the refactored main.go:

1. Ran linter checks on the refactored code: `golangci-lint run ./cmd/cursor-rules/main.go`
2. Built the binary: `go build -o bin/cursor-rules ./cmd/cursor-rules`
3. Tested basic functionality: `./bin/cursor-rules --version` and `./bin/cursor-rules list`

Results:

- **Success**: Main function no longer appears in cognitive complexity warnings
- **Success**: Binary builds successfully without errors
- **Success**: Basic functionality works correctly
- **Remaining issue**: setupProject function still has high cognitive complexity (29 > 20)
- **Remaining issue**: Some nestif issues in the package.json processing code

---

MEMO: The main function refactoring was successful, significantly reducing its cognitive complexity. The original complexity was 138, and it's now below the threshold of 20 since it doesn't appear in the linter warnings.

Next refactoring steps:

1. Fix the setupProject function which still has high cognitive complexity (29)
2. Address nested if blocks in the package.json processing code
3. Continue with the planned refactoring of RestoreFromShared() and UpgradeRule() in manager.go

## TS: 2025-03-24 06:57:30 CET

## PROBLEM: High cognitive complexity in RestoreFromShared() and UpgradeRule() functions

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Refactored RestoreFromShared() function:
  - Extracted loadShareableData() and loadShareableFromURL() for data loading
  - Created parseShareableLock() for JSON parsing and validation
  - Extracted buildExistingRuleSet() for conflict detection
  - Added resolveConflict() and promptForConflictResolution() for conflict handling
  - Created separate processing functions for each rule type
- Refactored UpgradeRule() function:
  - Extracted findRuleToUpgrade() to locate rules in the lockfile
  - Created upgradeBuiltInRule() for template-based rules
  - Added checkLocalModifications() and promptForLocalModifications() for change detection
  - Extracted type-specific upgrade handlers like upgradeGitHubBranchRule()
  - Improved error handling and added guard clauses

---

MEMO: This refactoring significantly reduces the cognitive complexity of these core functions, breaking them down into smaller, more focused helper functions. Each extracted function has a clear responsibility and meaningful name, making the code easier to understand and maintain. The refactoring preserves the original functionality while improving error handling and reducing nesting depth. By using guard clauses and early returns, the control flow is now flatter and easier to follow. These changes should help address both the cognitive complexity (gocognit) and nested if (nestif) linter issues.

## TS: 2025-03-24 06:59:00 CET

## PROBLEM: Task file for refactoring RestoreFromShared() and UpgradeRule() is in the wrong location

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Moved tasks/task-refactor-manager-complexity.md to go-claude/.tasks/ directory
- Maintained file structure and content without changes
- Kept the original refactoring plan detailed in the file

---

MEMO: Task files for the go-claude project should be stored in the go-claude/.tasks directory rather than the top-level tasks directory. This ensures that refactoring plans and documentation are properly organized within the monorepo structure, keeping each project's tasks separate and organized.

## TS: 2025-03-24 07:03:44 CET

## PROBLEM: Verification of refactoring progress for RestoreFromShared() and UpgradeRule() functions

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Run linter checks on the refactored code with `golangci-lint run --disable-all --enable gocognit,nestif`
- Verified that RestoreFromShared() no longer appears in cognitive complexity warnings
- Verified that UpgradeRule() no longer appears in cognitive complexity warnings
- Fixed additional issues identified during testing:
  - Added periods to all function documentation comments
  - Fixed parameter types per Go best practices (combined parameters of the same type)
  - Improved error handling in the upgradeGitHubBranchRule() function
  - Added loadOrCreateLockFile() function to simplify lockfile initialization

---

MEMO: The refactoring has successfully reduced the cognitive complexity of both target functions below the warning threshold (20). The extracted helper functions follow a consistent pattern and have clear responsibilities, making the code more maintainable. There are still some remaining complexity issues in other functions (LoadLockFile, RemoveRule, ShareRules, and processRule) which should be addressed in future refactoring iterations. The nestif issues have also been reduced significantly. This shows that our approach of extracting focused helper functions and using guard clauses is effective and should be continued for the remaining complex functions.

## TS: 2025-03-24 07:05:03 CET

## PROBLEM: Completed refactoring of high complexity functions in manager.go

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Successfully refactored RestoreFromShared() and UpgradeRule() functions:
  - Extracted 15+ focused helper functions with clear responsibilities
  - Significantly reduced cognitive complexity below warning thresholds
  - Fixed several related issues (comments, parameter types, error handling)
  - Improved code organization with logical grouping of related functionality
- Verified functionality with build and tests:
  - Confirmed binary builds successfully
  - Tested share and restore functionality
  - Verified restored rules work as expected
- Updated task documentation:
  - Marked completed tasks in .tasks/task-refactor-manager-complexity.md
  - Identified additional functions that need refactoring in future PRs

---

MEMO: This refactoring demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy to break down complex functions into smaller helper functions with single responsibilities. The approach of using guard clauses and early returns has successfully flattened nested conditionals and improved readability. The next priority functions for refactoring are LoadLockFile (complexity: 42), ShareRules (complexity: 33), RemoveRule (complexity: 31), and processRule (complexity: 22). We've established a solid pattern that can be applied to these remaining functions.
