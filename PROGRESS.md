## PROBLEM: Need to set up Cursor Rules for this project

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Initialized Cursor Rules using `go-claude/bin/cursor-rules setup` command
- Created .cursor/rules directory with appropriate templates:
  - init.mdc - Contains initialization instructions
  - setup.mdc - Project setup template
  - general.mdc - General purpose rules

---

MEMO:

- Cursor Rules are now ready to use in this project
- Templates have been adapted to the detected project type
- Rules will help improve AI assistance for this codebase

## PROBLEM: Need structured testing approach for the MVP implementation

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Created testing instructions for validating the MVP implementation
- Provided detailed manual testing steps for both npm/React and Python projects
- Documented expected outcomes for each project type
- Added proper cleanup instructions after testing

---

MEMO:

- To manually test the MVP, follow these steps:
  1. Build the binary: `go build -o bin/cursor-rules ./cmd/cursor-rules`
  2. Create test directories: `mkdir -p bin/test/{npm-project,python-project}`
  3. Create test package.json: `echo '{ "name": "test", "dependencies": { "react": "18.2.0" } }' > bin/test/npm-project/package.json`
  4. Create test setup.py: `echo 'from setuptools import setup; setup(name="test")' > bin/test/python-project/setup.py`
  5. Test npm init: `cd bin/test/npm-project && ../../cursor-rules --init`
  6. Test npm setup: `cd bin/test/npm-project && ../../cursor-rules --setup`
  7. Test Python init: `cd bin/test/python-project && ../../cursor-rules --init`
  8. Test Python setup: `cd bin/test/python-project && ../../cursor-rules --setup`
  9. Cleanup after testing: `rm -rf bin/test`
- Expected outcomes:
  - npm project: init.mdc, setup.mdc, react.mdc, general.mdc
  - Python project: init.mdc, setup.mdc, python.mdc, general.mdc

## TS: 2025-03-18 22:18:38 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to simplify command syntax and add shortcuts for better user experience

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Updated main.go to support both flag-style and command-style syntax:
  - `cursor-rules --init` → can now also use `cursor-rules init`
  - `cursor-rules --setup` → can now also use `cursor-rules setup`
- Added `CR_SETUP` as an alias for `CursorRules.setup` for use in Cursor editor
- Updated templates to document these new aliases
- Modified code to support this more intuitive command structure

---

MEMO:

- The tool can now be used with simpler commands:
  1. `cursor-rules init` - Creates the .cursor/rules directory with just the init template
  2. `cursor-rules setup` - Detects project type and sets up appropriate rules
- Inside Cursor editor, users can now use either:
  - `CursorRules.setup` (original command)
  - `CR_SETUP` (new shorter alias)
- Both the flag-style (`--init`, `--setup`) and command-style syntax work

## TS: 2025-03-18 22:26:34 CET

## PROBLEM: Needed to test cursor-rules functionality with example projects

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Built the cursor-rules binary using `go build -o bin/cursor-rules ./cmd/cursor-rules`
- Tested initialization in example npm project with `cursor-rules init`
- Verified creation of .cursor/rules directory with init.mdc file
- Tested setup in example npm project with `cursor-rules setup`
- Confirmed detection of npm/Node.js project with React dependency
- Verified creation of setup.mdc, react.mdc, and general.mdc files
- Tested initialization in example Python project with `cursor-rules init`
- Tested setup in example Python project with `cursor-rules setup`
- Confirmed detection of Python project
- Verified creation of setup.mdc, python.mdc, and general.mdc files

---

MEMO:

- The cursor-rules tool successfully detects project types and sets up appropriate rules
- Both flag-style and command-style syntax work as expected
- Each project type gets appropriate rule templates based on detected dependencies
- The testing confirmed that both npm/React and Python projects are properly supported

# Project Progress

## TS: 2025-03-22 16:19:11 CET

## PROBLEM: Need a more robust rule creation system with specialized components for planning, writing, critiquing, and finalizing

WHAT WAS DONE: Implemented a multi-agent architecture using Mastra's agent and workflow system:

1. Created four specialized agents:
   - Rule Planner: Analyzes examples and creates a detailed plan using GPT-4o-mini
   - Rule Writer: Implements the plan to write the actual rule
   - Rule Critic: Evaluates the rule against the request, providing feedback
   - Rule Finalizer: Incorporates feedback to produce the polished final rule
2. Developed a workflow that orchestrates these agents in sequence
3. Updated the CLI to integrate with the new workflow

---

MEMO: This pipeline approach significantly improves rule quality through separation of concerns. Each agent specializes in one aspect of rule creation, leading to more thoughtful planning, consistent implementation, thorough evaluation, and higher-quality output. The system leverages example analysis for better categorization and style matching.

## TS: 2025-03-22 16:21:01 CET

## PROBLEM: Need persistent memory in the rule creation system to maintain context across sessions

WHAT WAS DONE: Integrated Mastra's memory system into the rule creation workflow:

1. Added Memory configuration to the Mastra instance with:
   - Message history (lastMessages: 40)
   - Semantic search (topK: 5, messageRange: 2)
   - Working memory for persistent information
   - Thread title generation
2. Updated CLI to use resource and thread IDs for memory context
3. Added @mastra/memory dependency to package.json

---

MEMO: The memory system enables the agents to remember previous conversations and maintain context between sessions. This improves the quality of rules by allowing the system to learn from past interactions and reference previous work. Working memory helps maintain important context even with limited message history.

## TS: 2025-03-22 16:26:27 CET

## PROBLEM: Build is failing due to incorrect imports and TypeScript errors

WHAT WAS DONE:

1. Attempted to fix tool imports using @mastra/core/tools
2. Created multi-agent architecture files (orchestrator.ts)
3. Identified multiple TypeScript errors:
   - Wrong imports: 'agent' instead of 'Agent', 'toolWithDescription' instead of 'createTool'
   - Missing type declarations for parameters
   - Incorrect API usage for agent methods

---

MEMO: Need to update all agent files to use the correct Mastra API. Each agent should use the Agent class from @mastra/core with proper type definitions. The tools need to be updated to use createTool instead of toolWithDescription. Additional types need to be defined for all function parameters.

## TS: 2025-03-22 17:04:41 CET

## PROBLEM: Unclear where rules are saved in the Mastra-based rule creation system

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Analyzed the code to determine where and how rules are stored
- Identified that rules are saved to the local file system, not to Mastra docs or examples
- Found that rules are saved to a "generated-rules" directory in the project root
- Confirmed that the saving happens in src/index.ts, not within the Mastra system itself

---

MEMO: The rule creation workflow uses Mastra (plan, write, critique, finalize steps), but the actual file saving happens in the host application. Rules are organized by category paths in the generated-rules directory (e.g., "generated-rules/general/rule-name.mdc"). The Mastra workflow manages the creation process, while file persistence is handled by the host application.

## TS: 2025-03-22 19:27:09 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to plan implementation of a package manager-style API for cursor rules

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Created task.md file with detailed implementation plan
- Outlined 5 major steps for adding package manager functionality
- Designed two-layer architecture approach with low-level manager package and high-level CLI commands
- Documented necessary changes to existing code while maintaining backward compatibility

---

MEMO: The package manager-style API will provide npm-like functionality (add, remove, upgrade, list) while tracking installed rules in a lockfile. This approach allows for more granular management of rules and creates a foundation for future features like versioning and remote rule repositories.

## TS: 2025-03-23 00:11:27 CET

## PROBLEM: URL detection in the add command not working correctly

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Fixed the `add` command to detect URLs and file paths automatically
- Added smart routing to use `AddRuleByReference` when a URL or file path is detected
- Maintained support for traditional category-based rule addition for other cases
- Tested with GitHub URLs to ensure proper detection and handling
- Improved user experience by eliminating the need to use different commands for different reference types

---

MEMO: The enhancement makes the `cursor-rules add` command smarter by automatically detecting if the argument is a URL, file path, or rule key. URL and file paths are now routed to `AddRuleByReference` while traditional rule keys still use category-based `AddRule`. This means users can now use `cursor-rules add https://github.com/...` directly without needing to remember to use the `add-ref` command, making the CLI more intuitive and user-friendly.

## TS: 2025-03-23 00:16:10 CET

## PROBLEM: Command API needed simplification and standardization on reference-based rule addition

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Removed the category-based `add` command in favor of reference-based rule addition
- Made `add` and `add-ref` both use `AddRuleByReference`, with `add-ref` becoming an alias
- Updated all core functions (init, setup) to use the reference-based approach
- Simplified the help text to focus on file/URL references for better usability
- Updated documentation to reflect the simplified command interface
- Made sure all tests still pass with the new implementation

---

MEMO: The command interface is now more consistent and simpler to use. Instead of requiring users to know which category a rule belongs to, all rules are now simply added by referencing their source - either a local file or a GitHub URL. This creates a more intuitive workflow that matches modern package managers. The `add-ref` command is retained as an alias for `add` to maintain backward compatibility with existing scripts.

## TS: 2025-03-23 00:48:07 CET

## PROBLEM: README.md needed restructuring to improve user experience

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Reorganized README.md structure to prioritize user-centric information
- Added "Quick Start" section at the top with essential commands
- Moved installation and development sections to the bottom
- Simplified command reference to focus on the most common use cases
- Updated examples to reflect the new reference-based command interface
- Removed redundant "Package Manager Commands" section for clarity
- Created more logical flow from quick start to usage to examples

---

MEMO:
The updated README now follows a more user-focused structure, presenting the most immediately useful information first. New users can quickly get started with the top Quick Start section, then learn more about usage patterns, while development and installation details are appropriately placed at the bottom for those who need them. This organization better aligns with the simplified command interface that now relies entirely on reference-based rule addition.

## TS: 2025-03-23 21:19:24 CET

## PROBLEM: Enhance the "upgrade" command to properly track and update GitHub-based rules

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Added ContentSHA256 field to the RuleSource struct to track local modifications
- Enhanced handleGitHubBlob to store resolved commit hash and content hash
- Implemented a smarter UpgradeRule function that:
  - Detects local modifications to rule files
  - Checks if the latest commit on the branch has changed
  - Prompts the user before overwriting local changes
  - Displays commit hash changes during upgrades
- Added utility functions for Git commit handling

---

MEMO: The upgrade command now provides a true package-manager style experience:

- Rules from branches (like main) can be updated to the latest commit
- Rules pinned to specific commits remain pinned unless explicitly upgraded
- Local modifications are detected and protected
- The tool shows the exact commit hash changes during upgrades

## TS: 2025-03-23 22:46:01 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to implement "share rules" and "restore from shared" functionality

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Implemented ShareRules function in the manager package to export rules to a JSON file
- Created ShareableLock and ShareableRule structs to define the sharing format
- Added share command to the CLI with options for embedding content
- Implemented RestoreFromShared function to import rules from a shared JSON file
- Added restore command to the CLI with conflict resolution options
- Fixed compatibility between share and restore by ensuring they use the same format
- Added support for embedded content in shared rules
- Tested full sharing and restoring workflow across different directories

---

MEMO:

The share and restore functionality enables easy transfer of rules between projects or users. The implemented JSON format includes rule metadata and can optionally embed the actual rule content. When restoring shared rules, users can choose how to handle conflicts (skip/rename/overwrite) using the --auto-resolve flag. This feature is particularly useful for team collaboration and for maintaining consistent rule sets across multiple projects.
