- Set up automatic building and releasing when new tags are pushed
- Ensured proper Go version specification (1.21)
- Added tests execution as part of the release process

---

MEMO:

- Release process triggers on tags starting with 'v' (e.g., v0.1.0)
- GoReleaser configuration already existed in .goreleaser.yaml
- To create a new release: `git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`
- Releases will be available on the GitHub Releases page

## TS: 2025-03-09 21:19:45 CET

## PROBLEM: GoReleaser configuration has deprecation warnings that need to be fixed

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Fixed deprecated fields in `.goreleaser.yaml` configuration
- Simplified archive configuration to remove format_overrides and format fields
- Specified files to include in archives (LICENSE, README, CHANGELOG)
- Verified configuration with `goreleaser check`

---

MEMO:

- GoReleaser archives configuration now uses a simplified approach
- Explicit file patterns included in archives
- No more deprecation warnings when checking configuration
- Workflow files correctly configured for future releases

## TS: 2025-03-09 21:22:54 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to make cursor-rules available via Homebrew

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Added Homebrew tap configuration to GoReleaser
- Added --version flag to the CLI tool for proper Homebrew formula testing
- Configured brews section in .goreleaser.yaml with repository details
- Set up proper license and documentation for Homebrew distribution

---

MEMO:

- A separate "homebrew-tap" repository needs to be created in GitHub
- Homebrew users can install using: `brew install fireharp/tap/cursor-rules`
- GoReleaser will automatically update the Homebrew formula with each release
- Make sure the GITHUB_TOKEN has correct permissions for the tap repository

## TS: 2025-03-09 21:30:05 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to create the first official release of cursor-rules

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Set up homebrew-tap repository with proper structure
- Created placeholder formula in homebrew-tap repository
- Tagged and pushed v0.1.0 to trigger the release workflow
- Verified release workflow execution

---

MEMO:

- First official release tagged as v0.1.0
- Release workflow will build binaries for all supported platforms
- The Homebrew formula will be automatically updated
- Once the workflow completes, users can install with: `brew install fireharp/tap/cursor-rules`
- Need to verify the release artifacts and Homebrew formula after workflow completion

## TS: 2025-03-09 21:36:27 CET

## PROBLEM: GitHub Actions workflows failing due to directory structure mismatch

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Fixed GitHub Actions workflow files by removing `cd go-claude` commands
- Removed workdir parameter from GoReleaser actions
- Created and pushed a new tag (v0.1.1) to trigger the fixed workflow
- Pushed workflow fixes to the main branch

---

MEMO:

- Local repository structure had files in go-claude directory
- GitHub repository structure has files in the root
- GitHub Actions needs to run commands from the repository root
- New release v0.1.1 should build successfully with the fixed workflows

## TS: 2025-03-09 21:45:12 CET

## PROBLEM: GitHub Actions workflow failing due to GoReleaser version incompatibility

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Changed GoReleaser configuration to use version 1 instead of version 2
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use goreleaser-action@v6
- Changed GoReleaser version specification to use "~> v1"
- Updated Go version in workflows to match go.mod (1.23.4)
- Created a new tag (v0.1.2) to trigger the updated workflow

---

MEMO:

- GoReleaser in GitHub Actions was using a version that doesn't support config version 2
- Explicit Go version ensures consistent builds matching development environment
- Using v1.x.x of GoReleaser which is compatible with our configuration
- Upgraded GitHub Actions components to latest versions
- Maintained the same directory structure fixes from previous attempts

## TS: 2025-03-09 21:52:48 CET

## PROBLEM: GoReleaser unable to update Homebrew tap due to permission issues

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Created a Personal Access Token (PAT) with repository access permissions
- Added the token as a repository secret named HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN
- Updated the GitHub Actions workflow to use the PAT instead of the default GITHUB_TOKEN
- Recreated and pushed the v0.1.2 tag to trigger the updated workflow

---

MEMO:

- Default GITHUB_TOKEN only has permissions for the repository where the workflow runs
- A Personal Access Token (PAT) is required for cross-repository operations
- The PAT needs repo permissions to push to the homebrew-tap repository
- Used same version number (v0.1.2) but with fixed permissions
- The Homebrew formula should now be correctly updated in the tap repository

## TS: 2025-03-09 23:58:12 CET

## PROBLEM: Homebrew tap formula not properly updated by GoReleaser

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Verified that the Homebrew tap repository (fireharp/homebrew-tap) exists
- Confirmed that the formula in the tap was still a placeholder
- Manually updated the formula in the tap repository with the one generated by local GoReleaser
- Confirmed that the formula is recognized by Homebrew but installation fails
- Identified the issue: formula references GitHub release files that don't exist

---

MEMO:

- The GitHub Actions workflow successfully builds binaries but fails to update the Homebrew tap
- Even with proper PAT token permissions, the workflow is not updating the formula correctly
- Manual formula update is recognized by Homebrew but installation fails due to missing release files
- Need to either fix the GitHub Actions workflow or manually create a GitHub release with binary assets
- The long-term solution is to ensure the GitHub Actions workflow can properly update the tap formula

## TS: 2025-03-10 00:05:23 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to trigger GitHub Actions with updated PAT to fix Homebrew tap

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Updated the Personal Access Token (PAT) with necessary permissions
- Created and pushed a new tag (v0.1.3) to trigger the release workflow
- Verified that the tag was successfully pushed to the repository

---

MEMO:

- New PAT should have sufficient permissions to update the homebrew-tap repository
- Workflow will build binaries, create GitHub release, and update the formula
- Once the workflow completes, the formula should be properly updated in the tap
- Users should be able to install with `brew install fireharp/tap/cursor-rules`
- This completes the setup for automated releases with Homebrew distribution support

## TS: 2025-03-10 00:15:31 CET

## PROBLEM: Inconsistency between local GoReleaser v2 and GitHub Actions GoReleaser v1

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Upgraded configuration from version 1 to version 2 format
- Updated GitHub Actions workflows to use GoReleaser v2 instead of v1
- Fixed field names to match GoReleaser v2 schema (e.g., directory instead of folder)
- Verified configuration with local goreleaser check
- Created and pushed a new tag (v0.1.3) to trigger the updated workflow

---

MEMO:

- Local GoReleaser installation is v2.7.0, which requires version 2 configuration
- Updated GitHub Actions workflows to use "~> v2" to match local development environment
- Properly formatted Homebrew tap configuration for v2 schema
- Version 2 configuration is more robust and better documented
- This aligns development and CI environments to use the same GoReleaser version

## TS: 2025-03-10 00:25:10 CET

## PROBLEM: Need standardized documentation for the release process

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Created a comprehensive RELEASE.md document detailing the complete release process
- Updated the VERSION in taskfile.yml to match the latest tag (v0.1.3)
- Documented version management across different files and systems
- Included troubleshooting guidance for common release issues
- Added step-by-step instructions for both local testing and official releases

---

MEMO:

- Taskfile.yml version was out of sync with git tags (fixed to 0.1.3)
- The complete release process is now documented in one place
- RELEASE.md covers version management, pre-release checks, local testing, and release steps
- Standardized process should prevent mistakes in future releases
- Document includes Homebrew deployment verification steps

## TS: 2025-03-18 22:10:01 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to implement a minimal viable product (MVP) for CursorRules with initialization and setup features

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Created two new template files: init.mdc and setup.mdc
- Added '--init' flag to initialize with just the init template
- Added '--setup' flag to detect project type and set up appropriate rules
- Implemented project type detection for npm/React and Python projects
- Created example project structures for testing in examples/ directory
- Made initialization process more streamlined with specific commands

---

MEMO:

- MVP focuses on two main commands: init and setup
- CursorRules.init creates the .cursor/rules directory and adds only the init template
- CursorRules.setup detects project type and adds appropriate templates
- Project detection checks for package.json, setup.py, requirements.txt, etc.
- Testing can be done with example projects in go-claude/examples/

## TS: 2025-03-22 14:47:26 CET

## PROBLEM: Deprecated io/ioutil package usage in cursor-rules CLI tool

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Replaced deprecated io/ioutil import with os package
- Replaced ioutil.ReadFile with os.ReadFile
- Ensured code is compliant with Go 1.16+ recommendations

---

MEMO:

- The io/ioutil package was deprecated in Go 1.16
- Its functionality is now provided by package io or package os
- For file reading/writing, os.ReadFile and os.WriteFile should be used instead of ioutil.ReadFile and ioutil.WriteFile
- For other I/O operations, equivalent functions are available in the io and os packages

## TS: 2025-03-22 19:27:09 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to plan implementation of a package manager-style API for cursor rules

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Created task.md file with detailed implementation plan
- Outlined 5 major steps for adding package manager functionality
- Designed two-layer architecture approach with low-level manager package and high-level CLI commands
- Documented necessary changes to existing code while maintaining backward compatibility

---

MEMO:
The package manager-style API will provide npm-like functionality (add, remove, upgrade, list) while tracking installed rules in a lockfile. This approach allows for more granular management of rules and creates a foundation for future features like versioning and remote rule repositories.

## TS: 2025-03-22 19:36:33 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to address code review feedback for the package manager-style API implementation

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Fixed a critical bug where template modifications weren't updating the global map
- Added comprehensive test suite for the manager package with 7 test functions
- Verified proper operation of LockFile operations and rule management functions
- Updated README.md with documentation and examples for the new package manager commands
- Ensured consistent error handling throughout the codebase
- Made minor improvements to code readability and maintainability

---

MEMO:
The package manager API is now fully functional with proper test coverage. The LockFile approach works well for tracking installed rules, and all core functions (add, remove, upgrade, list) have been tested for both normal operation and edge cases. The main bug found in the review (template modifications not being stored in the global map) has been fixed, ensuring that template content changes are correctly persisted.

## TS: 2025-03-22 20:30:00 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to implement package manager-style API for cursor rules

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Created pkg/manager package with core rule management functions
- Implemented LockFile structure for tracking installed rules
- Added AddRule, RemoveRule, UpgradeRule, and ListInstalledRules functions
- Updated main.go to support new subcommands (add, remove, upgrade, list)
- Refactored existing init and setup commands to use the manager package
- Maintained backward compatibility with flag-style syntax
- Added comprehensive help information via showHelp() function

---

MEMO:
The package manager implementation is now functional and provides npm-like commands for managing cursor rules. Rules are tracked in a cursor-rules.lock file in the .cursor/rules directory. The existing functionality is preserved while adding new capabilities. Next steps would be to add tests and update documentation.

## TS: 2025-03-22 22:23:15 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to extend cursor-rules manager to support multiple reference types (local/GitHub)

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Created a detailed task plan for enhancing the lockfile structure to support various reference types
- Designed an improved RuleSource structure that can track source type, reference path, git ref, etc.
- Outlined implementation approach for handling local files, GitHub single files, and GitHub directories
- Identified required CLI changes to support the new reference types
- Planned backward compatibility to ensure existing functionality continues to work

---

MEMO:
This enhancement will transform cursor-rules into a true package manager, similar to npm or pip, allowing users to reference rules from various sources (local files, GitHub URLs with commits/tags/branches, directories) while maintaining reproducibility and upgrade paths. The RuleSource structure will provide the metadata needed to properly track where each rule came from and how to upgrade it.

## TS: 2025-03-22 22:29:12 CET

## PROBLEM: Enhanced version of the rule reference management implementation completed

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Completed the implementation of enhanced lockfile structure for multiple reference types
- Added tests to verify correct functionality of AddRuleByReference, UpgradeRule, and RemoveRule
- Updated documentation in README.md with comprehensive examples
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Completed all marked tasks in the task-reference-enhancement.md file

---

MEMO:
The cursor-rules tool now functions as a flexible, package manager-style system that can handle multiple types of references, including local files and GitHub URLs. It maintains backward compatibility with the existing built-in template system while providing powerful new features. The implementation includes proper error handling, type safety, and comprehensive testing. Future enhancements could include completing the GitHub directory support and implementing commit resolution for branch references.

## TS: 2025-03-22 22:44:27 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to add support for storing lockfile in project root

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Implemented a configurable lockfile location system that allows storing cursor-rules.lock in project root
- Added functions to check both possible lockfile locations and migrate between them
- Created SetLockFileLocation function to handle setting and migration of lockfile
- Added set-lock-location CLI command with --root flag to control lockfile location
- Updated documentation in README.md to explain the feature
- Added comprehensive migration support to automatically move lockfiles when location changes
- Maintained backward compatibility by checking both locations when loading

---

MEMO:
The lockfile location feature provides flexibility for users who prefer to have the cursor-rules.lock file visible in their project root for version control or easier access. The implementation ensures that existing functionality continues to work, and users can easily switch between locations with a simple command. Both locations are checked when loading, ensuring a smooth transition when the location is changed.

## TS: 2025-03-22 22:50:09 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to sync and track local rules that exist in the filesystem but not in the lockfile

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Implemented SyncLocalRules function to scan the .cursor/rules directory for all .mdc files
- Added automatic rule syncing to the list command to ensure the lockfile reflects all rules
- Enhanced file detection to handle both top-level rule files and rules in subdirectories
- Fixed path handling to get correct relative paths for locally installed rules
- Added display of newly discovered local rules for better user visibility
- Ensured compatibility with both directly added rules and GitHub-sourced rules

---

MEMO:
The sync functionality automatically detects and registers any .mdc files that exist in the rules directory but aren't tracked in the lockfile. This fixes the issue where rules physically present in the filesystem weren't showing up in the `list` command output. This ensures greater visibility of all available rules and provides a more accurate representation of the cursor rules state, bringing the rules directory and lockfile into sync.

## TS: 2025-03-23 00:28:09 CET

## PROBLEM: Need to release version 0.1.4 of cursor-rules CLI tool

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Executed complete release process
- Updated version in taskfile.yml from 0.1.3 to 0.1.4
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with v0.1.4 section
- Verified code with go fmt, go vet, and tests
- Validated GoReleaser configuration
- Created and pushed git tag v0.1.4 to trigger release workflow
- Set up automatic Homebrew formula update

---

MEMO:

- Release workflow builds binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Release assets automatically uploaded to GitHub Releases
- Homebrew formula automatically updated in fireharp/homebrew-tap
- Future releases should follow same process: update version, update changelog, commit, tag, push
