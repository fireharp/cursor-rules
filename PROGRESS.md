## PROBLEM: Need a CLI tool for Cursor editor rules initialization with template support

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Created a CLI tool for initializing Cursor editor rules
- Implemented multiple template categories (languages, frameworks)
- Added custom template creation functionality
- Built interactive template selection
- Established project structure with main application entry point, templates package, and configuration
- Set up documentation in README.md

---

MEMO:

- Tool creates .cursor/rules directory
- Provides pre-defined templates selection
- Supports custom template creation
- Run with: `go run cmd/cursor-rules/main.go`
- Or build with: `mkdir -p bin && go build -o bin/cursor-rules ./cmd/cursor-rules`

## PROBLEM: Need to update Template structure to support multiple globs and always-apply functionality

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Updated Template structure to include Globs array and AlwaysApply flag
- Enhanced template parsing logic for backward compatibility and new fields
- Improved template creation to support the new format
- Updated all example templates with new format including preamble text
- Created comprehensive taskfile.yml with build, test, coverage, and distribution options
- Added test cases for multiple globs parsing

---

MEMO:

- Templates now use globs (array) instead of glob (string)
- AlwaysApply flag controls whether rules always apply regardless of file type
- Format now includes frontmatter (description, globs, alwaysApply) followed by preamble and main content
- Enhanced development workflow with watch mode

## PROBLEM: Need automated release process for the cursor-rules CLI tool

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Configured GitHub Actions workflow for GoReleaser in .github/workflows/release.yml
- Set up automatic building and releasing when new tags are pushed
- Ensured proper Go version specification (1.21)
- Added tests execution as part of the release process

---

MEMO:

- Release process triggers on tags starting with 'v' (e.g., v0.1.0)
- GoReleaser configuration already existed in .goreleaser.yaml
- To create a new release: `git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`
- Releases will be available on the GitHub Releases page

## TS: 2025-03-09 21:19:45 CET

## PROBLEM: GoReleaser configuration has deprecation warnings that need to be fixed

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Fixed deprecated fields in `.goreleaser.yaml` configuration
- Simplified archive configuration to remove format_overrides and format fields
- Specified files to include in archives (LICENSE, README, CHANGELOG)
- Verified configuration with `goreleaser check`

---

MEMO:

- GoReleaser archives configuration now uses a simplified approach
- Explicit file patterns included in archives
- No more deprecation warnings when checking configuration
- Workflow files correctly configured for future releases

## PROBLEM: Need to make cursor-rules available via Homebrew

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Added Homebrew tap configuration to GoReleaser
- Added --version flag to the CLI tool for proper Homebrew formula testing
- Configured brews section in .goreleaser.yaml with repository details
- Set up proper license and documentation for Homebrew distribution

---

MEMO:

- A separate "homebrew-tap" repository needs to be created in GitHub
- Homebrew users can install using: `brew install fireharp/tap/cursor-rules`
- GoReleaser will automatically update the Homebrew formula with each release
- Make sure the GITHUB_TOKEN has correct permissions for the tap repository
