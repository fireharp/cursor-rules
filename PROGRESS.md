## PROBLEM: Need a CLI tool for Cursor editor rules initialization with template support

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Created a CLI tool for initializing Cursor editor rules
- Implemented multiple template categories (languages, frameworks)
- Added custom template creation functionality
- Built interactive template selection
- Established project structure with main application entry point, templates package, and configuration
- Set up documentation in README.md

---

MEMO:

- Tool creates .cursor/rules directory
- Provides pre-defined templates selection
- Supports custom template creation
- Run with: `go run cmd/cursor-rules/main.go`
- Or build with: `mkdir -p bin && go build -o bin/cursor-rules ./cmd/cursor-rules`

## PROBLEM: Need to update Template structure to support multiple globs and always-apply functionality

WHAT WAS DONE:

- Updated Template structure to include Globs array and AlwaysApply flag
- Enhanced template parsing logic for backward compatibility and new fields
- Improved template creation to support the new format
- Updated all example templates with new format including preamble text
- Created comprehensive taskfile.yml with build, test, coverage, and distribution options
- Added test cases for multiple globs parsing

---

MEMO:

- Templates now use globs (array) instead of glob (string)
- AlwaysApply flag controls whether rules always apply regardless of file type
- Format now includes frontmatter (description, globs, alwaysApply) followed by preamble and main content
- Enhanced development workflow with watch mode
